            <p>IMC Financial Markets is a high-frequency/algorithmic trading firm based out of Amsterdam. I had the opportunity to intern at IMC this past summer as a software engineer in their Chicago office, and my project was to create a trades analysis tool that leveraged Spark and HDFS.<br><br>I can't go too much more into detail, as the specifics of what I completed are proprietary (I've always wanted to be able to say this, and now I finally can!), but the gist of my project was to process hundreds of thousands of trades a day to provide concrete reasons as to why IMC might have missed out on profitable opportunities.

            <p>Nisa Investment Advisors is an investment manager based out of St. Louis that primarily serves institutional investors. I interned with Nisa during the fall of my junior year at Wash U, and filled a fairly general software IT role.<br><br>My first project was to create an OData service to parse data from a SQL Server view and display the data to a web endpoint, which was implemented primarily in C# and (obviously) made use of the OData RESTful API.<br><br>For the remainder of the semester, I architechted a proof-of-concept version zero of an automated testing framework to routinely test Nisa's proprietary web applications. I wrote the TestComplete test suite in a built-in language called TestComplete JScript, and implemented the surrounding software that automated and recorded the tests using C# and MySQL.</p>

            <p>Unbeknownst to many, Visa is not actually in the credit card industry, but is instead a payments technology company. You learn something new every day! I interned at Visa in Austin my sophomore summer, and was a "Switching Systems and Network Processing Intern" (but you and I can just say "Software Developer Intern").<br><br>My biggest project that summer was optimizing and benchmarking Visa standard library functions in C++ to reduce overhead, which resulted in a whopping 2.6% improvement in system performance. If 2.6 doesn't seem like a big enough number for you, this might do the trick: the updates I made will save Visa $1,000,000 in rented black box space every three year cycle.</p>

For every soccer ball bought, Kizazi takes a portion of the net profits and sends them over to Kiva to fund microloans for aspiring entrepreneurs in developing countries.<br><br>I worked for Kizazi my freshman summer, and my main focus was creating the website (though in a team of only five people, I had a lot of responsibilities all across the board).

            <p>Frontier Utilities is Texas-based energy provider. I was lucky enough to work there the summer before I started college as a data analysis/IT intern. This was my first "real job", and much to my surprise I actually got to do things other than make coffee and move stacks of paper from point A to point B.<br><br>Instead, I was mentored directly by the company's CIO and worked on a variety of projects as they came up. I used MySQL and Excel to create in-depth reports on customer and company activity, such as P&L for a zipcode or client retention during a given month. And, I wrote a few SQL stored procedures to update underlying data for reports that were then fed to users through an internal web app.</p>

          <p>I like helping people learn stuff, and the sections below highlight some of the ways I've tried to give back to the community as an "educator" (if I can even call myself that).<br><br>I think I'd like to some day teach Computer Science to middle or high schoolers, but for the time being I'm looking into ed-tech as a way to combine my passion for peer improvement with my love for software development.</p>

            <p>I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, during my sophomore and junior years. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger students get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes.<br><br>Additionally during that time, I served as an Engineering Tutor, which gave me the opportunity to work one-on-one with struggling students to help them with some of the tougher concepts (*cough* recursion *cough*).</p>

LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations.<br><br>As a trained LIVE facilitator, I am in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, and sports teams on campus.</p>

            <p>While in high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra. These weekly sessions were my first real experience in peer education, and it's been a lot of fun going home during breaks from college and seeing the kids I tutored grow up to become successful in high school and beyond.<br><br>I was also the assistant coach at my high school's summer soccer camp, herding kids from 5-12 years old and (hopefully) improving their technical skills along the way.</p>

          <p>I've showcased a couple independent projects I've worked on below, both of which you'll notice are small games (source code is available by clicking either game's corresponding image). I've been an avid gamer my whole life, from PokÃ©mon Red on the Game Boy Color to ranking in the top 5,000 League of Legends players in North America, and my love for videogames reflects in the software development I find myself doing on my own time.<br><br>Of course, you're looking at another side project I've worked on right now. This website, like me, will pretty much always be a work in progress, and I hope to keep improving and adding to it as my life unfolds.

              <p>You're a soldier of the elite "commando" status, battling off hordes of enemies all by yourself. A lone commando, if you will. This was my first foray into the world of game development, and for a high schooler who was just dabbling I think it turned out alright. There are powerups, grenades, tanks, attack wolves... What more could you want?</p>

              <p>For some reason, all these red dots feel the need to eat you. You control your dot with the mouse, and if you're quick enough and grab the right powerups at the right time, you might just survive! Except there is an unending, infinite supply of hungry dots, so... Good luck.</p>
