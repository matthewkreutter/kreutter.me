        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I like building food, listening to software, and eating music, and I tend to approach things a little differently than the status quo.<br><br>If you'd like to discuss how we might be able to work together in the future (or even just to chat), don't hesitate to get in touch by clicking the little mail icon above! You can peruse my resume (bit of a tongue twister, eh?) and some other cool stuff about me by clicking the hamburger in the top left.</p>

          <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
          <p>I've interned all over the place, from the energy sector to a philanthropic sports equipment supplier, and each experience has given me some interesting insight into how software impacts our lives. For some specifics on my work experience, take a look below at some of the stuff I've accomplished in and around the industry. If you'd prefer a more minimalist, nitty-gritty overview, check out my resume or my LinkedIn.<br><br> To make things a bit easier, here's the quick and dirty summary: I optimized STL functions at Visa to save them $1,000,000 in black box space every three years; I architected an automated testing framework at Nisa that keeps their proprietary web applications in check; and, I built a trades analysis tool at IMC that evaluates missed quoting opportunities and provides an in-depth reason as to why we didn't execute on a profitable trade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featured-box">
          <img src="assets/IMCLogo.png"/>
          <p>IMC Financial Markets is a proprietary trading firm and key market maker in various products across exchanges worldwide, with offices in Chicago, Amsterday, and Sydney. Some other buzzwords that might clear things up (or maybe just make it worse): IMC is a high frequency, algorithmic trading firm that offers liquidity to over 200,000 securities on over 100 exchanges, and is a global market-maker on equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies.<br><br> I had the opportunity to intern at IMC this past summer as a software engineer, and my project was to create a trades analysis tool that leveraged Spark and HDFS to process hundreds of thousands of missed trades a day to provide traders with concrete reasons for why we missed out on profitable opportunities. Unfortunately, I can't go too much more in detail as the majority of my work was proprietary (I've always wanted to be able to say this, and now I finally can!), but overall I had a great time working in their Chicago office.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featured-box">
          <img src="assets/NisaLogo.png"/>
          <p>Nisa Investment Advisors is an investment manager for institutional investors, based out of St. Louis. They focus on risk-controlled asset management, and have been reported to have over $140B in AUM, if you were curious (I was, which is why I Googled it while writing this section). I interned with Nisa during the fall of my junior year at Wash U, and was in a fairly general software IT role while there.<br><br>My first project was to create an OData service to parse data from a SQL Server view and display the data to a web endpoint, which was implemented primarily in C# and (obviously) made use of the OData RESTful API. For the remainder of my semester, I was in charge of architechting a proof-of-concept/version zero for an automated testing framework to routinely test Nisa's proprietary web applications. I wrote the testing itself in TestComplete, making use of a built-in language called TestComplete JScript, and built the surrounding software to automate the tests and log results in C# and SQL.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featured-box">
          <img src="assets/VisaLogo.png"/>
          <p>Visa, unbeknownst to many, is not actually in the credit card industry, but is instead a payments technology company. You learn something new every day! I interned at Visa in Austin my sophomore summer, and was, on paper, a "Switching Systems and Network Processing Intern", but you and I can just say "Software Developer Intern". I had a bunch of small projects throughout the summer, but I'll try and highlight some of the bigger ones here.<br><br>The biggest of my projects, which I mentioned in the blurb above, was optimizing Visa standard library functions to reduce overhead, which resulted in a whopping 2.6% improvement in system performance after benchmarking. If 2.6 didn't seem like a big enough number for you, this might do the trick: the updates I made will save Visa $1,000,000 in rented black box space every three year cycle. Pretty neat, huh?<br><br>Another notable project I worked on towards the end of the summer was creating the framework for a plugin that would allow users to test proprietary message types in SoapUI instead of just REST and SOAP messages. I wasn't able to finish before the summer ended, but it was a fun exercise in (kinda) learning how Apache Maven (vaguely) works.</p>

          <h1>Peer Education</h1>
          <p>I like helping people learn stuff -- there's something special about seeing someone's face light up when they finally understand a concept or problem you're going through. There's also just so much I've learned from teaching, whether it's gaining a deeper understanding of CS topics or becoming a more confident person in front of crowds, and all three experiences below have been incredibly rewarding.<br><br> I think that eventually I will want to become a teacher full time, maybe for something like introductory Computer Science at the middle school level to create the next generation of supercoders. But, with regards to my plans immediately after graduating, I think that ed-tech might be the best industry to mix my passion for education and software development. Who knows what the future holds!</p>

        <div class="featured-box">

          <p>I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, for sophomore and junior year. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger devs get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes. Additionally, I served as an Engineering Tutor, which gave me the opportunity to work one-on-one with struggling students to help them with some of the tougher concepts (*cough* recursion *cough*).</p>

          <p>I am a proud member of an on-campus student group called LIVE (Leaders in Interpersonal Violence Education). LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations. As a trained LIVE facilitator, I am in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, and sports teams on campus.</p>

          <p>In high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra, which was my first real experience in "teaching". Additionally, I was the assistant coach at my school's summer soccer camp, herding kids from 5-12 years old and (hopefully) improving their technical skills along the way.</p>

          <p>I've showcased a couple random projects I've worked on below, two of which you'll notice are small games. I've been an avid gamer my whole life, all the way from Pokémon Red on the Game Boy Color to ranking in the top 5,000 League of Legends players in North America.<br><br>While I haven't yet had the chance to fully dive deep into game development, it's an industry I hope to one day enter, as reflected by the software development I find myself doing in my spare time. Anyway, enough chit-chat... Let's explore some of my projects!</p>

              <p>You're a soldier of the elite "commando" status, battling off hordes of enemies all by yourself. A lone commando, if you will. This was my first foray into the world of game development, and for a high schooler who was just dabbling I think it turned out alright. There are powerups, grenades, tanks, attack wolves... What more could you want?</p>

For every soccer ball bought, Kizazi takes a portion of the net profits and sends them over to Kiva to fund microloans for aspiring entrepreneurs in underprivileged or developing countries.<br><br>I was in charge of the website, though in a team of five people, I had to pick up different responsibilities all across the board.

              <h2>This Website</h2>
              <p>One of my friends mentioned Github Pages in passing, and I thought it might be a fun exercise to build a website about myself. I snatched up the heavily sought after domain "kreutter.me", and the rest is history!<br><br> This site, like me, will pretty much always be a work in progress, and I intend to keep improving it here and there. You can see the source code on my Github, if you'd like to see why what you're looking at looks the way it does.</p>
