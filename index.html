          <p>I am a CS major with a passion for education reform. After a handful of software engineering internships, I pivoted into Teach For America and have been working to close the achievement gap for the past two years.<br><br>With my time with Teach For America coming to a close, I am looking to transition out of the classroom and into a product or customer solutions role at an innovative ed-tech company.

            <p>IMC Financial Markets is a high-frequency/algorithmic trading firm based out of Amsterdam. I had the opportunity to intern at IMC's Chicago office during the summer of 2017 as a software engineer on their Equity Options team. My project was to create a trades analysis tool in Java that leveraged Spark and HDFS.<br><br>The intention of my project was to accurately and efficiently process terabytes of trade data a day to provide concrete reasons as to why IMC might have missed out on profitable opportunities in the market. By the end of the summer, my intern team and I made significant enough progress that the tool was put into production to be used by traders on a daily basis.

            <p>I interned with Nisa Investment Advisors, an investment manager based in St. Louis that primarily serves institutional investors, during the fall in 2016. My first project was to create an OData service to parse data from an SQL Server view and display the data to a web endpoint, which was implemented primarily in C# and made use of the OData RESTful API.<br><br>For the remainder of the semester, I architechted a proof-of-concept automated testing framework to routinely test Nisa's proprietary web applications. I wrote the TestComplete test suite in a built-in language called TestComplete JScript and implemented the surrounding software that automated and recorded the tests using C# and MySQL.</p>

            <p>I interned with Visa, one of the largest transaction processing companies in the world, during the summer of 2016 as a Switching Systems and Network Processing Intern. Over the course of my internship, I primarily worked on their payment processing backend systems, but occasionally would be pulled onto smaller ad-hoc projects across the board.<br><br>My biggest project that summer was optimizing and benchmarking Visa standard library functions in C++ to reduce overhead, which resulted in a 2.6% improvement in system performance. Although a 2.6% change may not seem that drastic, the improved processing speed will save Visa $1,000,000 in rented black box space every three year cycle.</p>

            <img src="assets/KizaziLogo.png" class="logo-image-long">
            <p>A good friend of mine wanted to use the world's love for soccer to fuel altruism, and from his vision Kizazi was born. For every soccer ball bought, Kizazi donated a portion of their net profits to Kiva to fund microloans for aspiring entrepreneurs in developing countries. Although the venture has since shut down, I learned a ton from the experience.<br><br>I worked for Kizazi the summer of 2015 as their sole engineer, my main focus being the creation of their website from the ground up. Given the size and structure of the company at the time, though, I frequently took on additional tasks (SEO analysis and planning, online marketing campaigns, and user outreach come to mind).

            <p>Frontier Utilities is Texas-based energy provider that focuses on providing affordability and flexibility to its customers. I was lucky enough to work there the summer before I started college as a data analysis/IT intern. This was my first "real job", and much to my surprise I actually got to do things other than make coffee and move stacks of paper from point A to point B.<br><br>Instead, I was mentored directly by the company's CIO and worked on a variety of projects as they came up. I used MySQL and Excel to create in-depth reports on customer and company activity, such as profits for a zipcode or client retention during a given month. On top of that, I wrote a few SQL stored procedures to update underlying data for reports that were then fed to users through an internal web app.</p>

          <hr class="faded-sides">
          <p>The concept of education has always been important to me. Leading up to my two year tenure with Teach For America, I had a number of experiences supporting the learning goals of others, each of which helped ignite my passion for education reform.</p>

            <p>I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, during my sophomore and junior years in college. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger students get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes.<br><br>Additionally during that time, I served as an Engineering Tutor, which gave me the opportunity to work one-on-one with struggling students to help them with some of the tougher concepts.</p>

LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations.<br><br>As a trained LIVE facilitator, I am in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, and sports teams on campus.</p>

            <p>While in high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra. These weekly sessions were my first real experience in peer education, and it's been a lot of fun going home during breaks from college and seeing the kids I tutored grow up to become successful in high school and beyond.<br><br>I was also the assistant coach at my high school's summer soccer camp, herding kids from 5-12 years old and (hopefully) improving their technical skills along the way.</p>

          <p>I've showcased a couple independent projects I've worked on below, both of which you'll notice are small games (source code is available by clicking either game's corresponding image).

              <p>This was my first foray into the world of game development, and for a high schooler who was just dabbling I think it turned out alright. There are powerups, grenades, tanks, attack wolves... Everything you'd need for a successful videogame!</p>

              <p>For my second attempt at creating a game, I went with a more minimalist approach. You control a blue dot that is constantly on the run from aggressive red dots - no guns or grenades, but tons of different powerups to choose from.</p>
