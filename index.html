        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I like building food, listening to software, and eating music, and I tend to approach things a little differently than the status quo.<br><br>If you'd like to discuss how we might be able to work together in the future (or even just to chat), don't hesitate to get in touch by clicking the little mail icon above! You can peruse my resume (bit of a tongue twister, eh?) and some other cool stuff about me by clicking the hamburger in the top left.</p>

        <div class="flex-portfolio-text">
          <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
          <p>I've interned all over the place, from the energy sector to a philanthropic sports equipment supplier, and each experience has given me some interesting insight into how software impacts our lives. For specifics about my work experience, take a look below at some of the stuff I've accomplished in and around the industry. If you'd prefer a more minimalist, nitty-gritty overview, check out my resume or my LinkedIn.</p>

            <img src="assets/IMCLogo.png" class="logo-image-long"/>
            <p>IMC Financial Markets is a high-frequency/algorithmic/proprietary trading firm and key market maker in various products across exchanges worldwide, with offices in Chicago, Amsterdam, and Sydney.<br><br> I had the opportunity to intern at IMC this past summer as a software engineer, and my project was to create a trades analysis tool that leveraged Spark and HDFS to process hundreds of thousands of missed trades a day to provide traders with concrete reasons for why we missed out on profitable trading opportunities.

            <img src="assets/NisaLogo.png" class="logo-image-long"/>
            <p>Nisa Investment Advisors is an investment manager for institutional investors, based out of St. Louis. They focus on risk-controlled asset management, and have been reported to have over $140B in AUM (if you were curious... I was, which is why I Googled it while writing this section). I interned with Nisa during the fall of my junior year at Wash U, and was in a fairly general software IT role while there.<br><br>My first project was to create an OData service to parse data from a SQL Server view and display the data to a web endpoint, which was implemented primarily in C# and (obviously) made use of the OData RESTful API. For the remainder of the semester, I was in charge of architechting a proof-of-concept/version zero for an automated testing framework to routinely test Nisa's proprietary web applications. I wrote the test suite in TestComplete, making use of a built-in language called TestComplete JScript, and implemented the surrounding software that automated and recorded the tests in C# and SQL.</p>

            <img src="assets/VisaLogo.png" class="logo-image-long"/>
            <p>Unbeknownst to many, Visa is not actually in the credit card industry, but is instead a payments technology company. You learn something new every day! I interned at Visa in Austin my sophomore summer, and was technically a "Switching Systems and Network Processing Intern", but you and I can just say "Software Developer Intern". I had a bunch of small projects throughout the summer, but I'll try and highlight some of the bigger ones for the sake of brevity.<br><br>The biggest of my projects was optimizing and benchmarking Visa standard library functions to reduce overhead, which resulted in a whopping 2.6% improvement in system performance. If 2.6 doesn't seem like a big enough number for you, this might do the trick: the updates I made will save Visa $1,000,000 in rented black box space every three year cycle. Pretty neat, huh?<br><br>Another notable project I worked on towards the end of the summer was creating the framework for a plugin that would allow users to test proprietary message types in SoapUI in addition to the usual REST and SOAP messages. I wasn't able to finish before the summer ended, but it was a fun exercise in (kinda) learning how Apache Maven (vaguely) works for custom plugins.</p>

For every soccer ball bought, Kizazi takes a portion of the net profits and sends them over to Kiva to fund microloans for aspiring entrepreneurs in underprivileged or developing countries.<br><br>I worked for Kizazi my freshman summer, and my main focus was creating the website (though in a team of only five people, I had to pick up different responsibilities all across the board).

            <p>Frontier Utilities is a local Texas energy company that strives to provide low-cost, high quality service to its customers. I was lucky enough to work there the summer before I started college, and served as a very general data analysis / IT intern. This was my first "real job", and much to my surprise I actually got to do things other than move paper around and make coffee.<br><br>Instead, I was mentored by the company's CIO and given a variety of real tasks over the course of the summer. I wrote SQL queries to create in-depth reports on customer and company activity, such as P&L for a zipcode or client retention during a given month. Additionally, I wrote a few SQL stored procedures to update underlying data for reports that were then fed to users through an internal web app.</p>

          <h1>Peer Education</h1>
          <p>I like helping people learn stuff -- there's something special about seeing someone's face light up when they finally understand a concept or problem you're going through. There's also just so much I've learned from teaching, whether it's gaining a deeper understanding of CS topics or becoming a more confident person in front of crowds, and all three experiences below have been incredibly rewarding.<br><br> I think that eventually I will want to become a teacher full time, maybe for something like introductory Computer Science at the middle school level to create the next generation of supercoders. But, with regards to my plans immediately after graduating, I think that ed-tech might be the best industry to mix my passion for education and software development. Who knows what the future holds!</p>

            <img src="assets/WashULogo.png" class="logo-image-square"/>
            <p>I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, during sophomore and junior year. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger devs get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes. Additionally, I served as an Engineering Tutor, which gave me the opportunity to work one-on-one with struggling students to help them with some of the tougher concepts (*cough* recursion *cough*).</p>

            <p>I'm a member of an on-campus student group called LIVE (Leaders in Interpersonal Violence Education). LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations. As a trained LIVE facilitator, I am in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, and sports teams on campus.</p>

            <p>While in high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra. These weekly sessions were my first real experience in "teaching", and it has been a lot of fun going home during breaks and seeing the kids I tutored grow up to become successful in high school and beyond. Additionally, I was the assistant coach at my school's summer soccer camp, herding kids from 5-12 years old and (hopefully) improving their technical skills along the way.</p>

            <p>You're a soldier of the elite "commando" status, battling off hordes of enemies all by yourself. A lone commando, if you will. This was my first foray into the world of game development, and for a high schooler who was just dabbling I think it turned out alright. There are powerups, grenades, tanks, attack wolves... What more could you want?</p>

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>One of my friends mentioned Github Pages in passing, and I thought it might be a fun exercise to build a website about myself. I snatched up the heavily sought after domain "kreutter.me", and the rest is history!<br><br> This site, like me, will pretty much always be a work in progress. I hope to keep improving and adding to it as my life unfolds. If you'd like to see why what you're looking at looks the way it does, check out the source code on Github linked below.</p>
