        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I like building food, listening to software, and eating music, and I tend to approach things a little differently than the status quo.<br><br>If you'd like to discuss how we might be able to work together in the future (or even just to chat), don't hesitate to get in touch by clicking the little mail icon above!</p>

          <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
          <p>I've interned all over the place, from the energy sector to a philanthropic sports equipment supplier, and each experience has given me unique insight into how software impacts our lives.<br><br> Take a look below at some of the stuff I've accomplished in and around the industry. If you'd prefer a more minimalist, nitty-gritty overview, check out my resume or my LinkedIn.</p>

          <h1>Peer Education</h1>
          <p>I like helping people learn stuff. In high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra, which was my first real experience in "teaching". Additionally, I was the assistant coach at my school's summer soccer camp, herding kids from 5-12 years old and (hopefully) improving their technical skills along the way.<br><br> In college, I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, for sophomore and junior year. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger devs get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes.<br><br>Last but certainly not least, I was a member of an on-campus student group called LIVE (Leaders in Interpersonal Violence Education). LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations. As a trained LIVE facilitator, I was in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, or sports teams on campus.</p>

          <p>I've showcased a couple random projects I've worked on below, two of which are small games. I've been an avid gamer my whole life, all the way from Pokémon Red on the Game Boy Color to ranking in the top 5,000 League of Legends players in North America.<br><br>While I haven't yet had the chance to fully dive deep into game development, it's an industry I hope to one day enter, as reflected by the software development I find myself doing in my spare time.</p>
