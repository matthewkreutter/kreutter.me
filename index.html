            <p>IMC Financial Markets is a high-frequency/algorithmic trading firm based out of Amsterdam. I had the opportunity to intern at IMC in the summer of 2017 as a software engineer in their Chicago office, and my project was to create a trades analysis tool in Java that leveraged Spark and HDFS.<br><br>The intention of my project was to accurately and efficiently process terabytes of trade data a day to provide concrete reasons as to why IMC might have missed out on profitable opportunities in the market. By the end of the summer, my intern team and I made significant enough progress that the tool was put into production to be used by traders on a daily basis.

            <p>Nisa Investment Advisors is an investment manager based in St. Louis that primarily serves institutional investors. I interned with Nisa during the fall of 2016, and filled a fairly general software IT role.<br><br>My first project was to create an OData service to parse data from an SQL Server view and display the data to a web endpoint, which was implemented primarily in C# and made use of the OData RESTful API.<br><br>For the remainder of the semester, I architechted a proof-of-concept version zero of an automated testing framework to routinely test Nisa's proprietary web applications. I wrote the TestComplete test suite in a built-in language called TestComplete JScript, and implemented the surrounding software that automated and recorded the tests using C# and MySQL.</p>

            <p>I interned with Visa in Austin the summer of 2016 as a Switching Systems and Network Processing Intern, working specifically on their payment processing backend systems.<br><br>My biggest project that summer was optimizing and benchmarking Visa standard library functions in C++ to reduce overhead, which resulted in a 2.6% improvement in system performance. Although a 2.6% change may not seem that drastic, the improved processing speed will save Visa $1,000,000 in rented black box space every three year cycle.</p>

            <p>Frontier Utilities is Texas-based energy provider. I was lucky enough to work there the summer before I started college as a data analysis/IT intern. This was my first "real job", and much to my surprise I actually got to do things other than make coffee and move stacks of paper from point A to point B.<br><br>Instead, I was mentored directly by the company's CIO and worked on a variety of projects as they came up. I used MySQL and Excel to create in-depth reports on customer and company activity, such as profits for a zipcode or client retention during a given month. On top of that, I wrote a few SQL stored procedures to update underlying data for reports that were then fed to users through an internal web app.</p>

            <p>I was a Computer Science TA for the introductory Java class, CSE131, during my sophomore and junior years in college. I specifically stayed with the introductory class because I felt that it gave me the best opportunity to help younger students get a solid foundation in CS before moving on to tougher classes.<br><br>Additionally during that time, I served as an Engineering Tutor, which gave me the opportunity to work one-on-one with struggling students to help them with some of the tougher concepts.</p>

LIVE provides facilitations regarding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity with the goal of creating a safe, productive environment for some tough -- but necessary -- conversations.<br><br>As a trained LIVE facilitator, I am in charge of giving presentations and guiding discussions for other student groups, class sections, and sports teams on campus.</p>

            <p>While in high school, I tutored two middle schoolers in Spanish and algebra.

          <p>I've showcased a couple independent projects I've worked on below, both of which you'll notice are small games (source code is available by clicking either game's corresponding image). I've been an avid gamer my whole life, from Pokémon Red on the Game Boy Color to ranking in the top 5,000 League of Legends players in North America, and my love for videogames reflects in the software development I find myself doing in my free time.<br><br>Of course, you're looking at another side project I've worked on right now.

              <p>You're a soldier of the elite "commando" status, battling off hordes of enemies all by yourself. A lone commando, if you will. This was my first foray into the world of game development, and for a high schooler who was just dabbling I think it turned out alright. There are powerups, grenades, tanks, attack wolves... Everything you'd need for a successful videogame!</p>

              <p>For some reason, all these red dots feel the need to eat you. You control your blue dot with the mouse, and if you're quick enough and grab the right powerups at the right time, you might just survive! Except there is an unending, infinite supply of hungry dots, so... Good luck.</p>
