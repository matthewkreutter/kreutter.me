        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship.<br><br> I like building food, listening to software, and eating music, and enjoy approaching things a little differently than the status quo.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="landing-text work-projects">
        <h1>Work Experience / Projects</h1>
        <p>I've interned all over the place, from the energy sector to a philanthropic sports equipment supplier, and each experience has given me some perspective on how software impacts our lives.<br><br> Take a look below at some of the stuff I've accomplished in and around the industry. If you'd prefer a more minimalist, nitty-gritty overview, check out my resume or my LinkedIn.</p>
